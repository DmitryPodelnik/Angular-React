  <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>

  <p>
    I live in NYC and right now I work on some startup ideas in the data space.
  <p>
    From Feb 2015 to Jan 2021, I ran the (300-person) tech team at Better.com ‚Äì a company rethinking how mortgages are
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before Better, I was at Spotify for 6 years. I spent 2.5 years in Stockholm managing the "Analytics"
    team and then 3.5 years in NYC building up and managing the machine learning team. I built the first
    version of (and most of the sauce still powering) Spotify's music recommendations, such as "Related Artists",
    Radio, Discover Weekly, etc. At Spotify I also open sourced a couple of tools, including Luigi ‚Äì a workflow
    engine with 10,000+ stars and 200+ contributors on Github, and Annoy ‚Äì a library to do find approximate nearest
    neighbors in high dimensional spaces.

  <p>
    I joined Spotify after graduating with a M. Sc. in Physics from KTH in Stockholm, where I'm originally from.
    During my university years, I did a few internships, including a six month stint at Google in Z√ºrich.
    I also worked briefly with high frequency trading and a couple of other things. During university and
    high school I got involved with programming competitions. I have a gold medal from IOI and I participated
    in the ACM-ICPC world finals twice. In high school I won the Swedish physics competition as well as the
    Swedish programming competition.

    Besides blogging, I also tweet random things every once in a while. I also occasionally write code for
    fun in my spare time. If there's something I know a lot about, I sometimes give talks about it: I have
    talked about approximate nearest neighbors, Luigi, and machine learning for music recommendations.
    I am the co-organizer of the NYC Machine Learning meetup which has talks once a month.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I write code I usually do it in Python, but I've been using a dozen different languages since
    I started writing code 25 years ago. Most of what I've been doing last few years has been machine
    learning, data engineering, and backend development. I still write code some fraction of my time,
    but focus a lot more on management now, in particular recruiting and how to build a performance culture.
